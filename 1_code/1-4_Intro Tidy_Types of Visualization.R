# 4. TYPES OF VISUALIZATION

# 4.1 Types of plots ####

# There are many types of graph that can be made in ggplot2, each of which is useful for visualizing a particular type of data:
# scatter plot: useful for comparing 2 variables.
# line plot: useful for showing change over time.
# bar plot: good at comparing statistics for each of several categories.
# histogram: describes the distribution of a one-dimensional numeric variable.
# box plot: compares the distribution of a numeric variable among several categories.

# Loading the gapminder, dplyr and ggplot2 packages:
library(gapminder) # tracks economic and social indicators of countries over time.
library(dplyr) # provides step-by-step to transform data.
library(ggplot2) # create elegant data visualizations using the grammar of graphics.

# 4.2 Line plot ####

# A line plot is useful for visualizing trends over time. Line plots make it clearer than scatter plots that what we care about is the upward or downward trend over time.
# Examine how the median GDP per capita has changed over time by first summarizing the median gdpPercap by year:
by_year <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(medianGdpPercap = median(gdpPercap))
# Create a line plot:
ggplot(by_year, aes(year, medianGdpPercap)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  expand_limits(y = 0) # the only difference with the scatter plot is geom_line() instead of geom_point().
# Examine the change within each continent:
by_year_continent <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(year, continent) %>%
  summarize(medianGdpPercap = median(gdpPercap))
# Add color in the aes code:
ggplot(by_year_continent, aes(year, medianGdpPercap, 
                              color = continent)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  expand_limits(y = 0)

# 4.3 Bar plot ####

# A bar plot is useful for comparing values across discrete categories, such as continents. visualizing summary statistics, such as the median GDP in each continent. 
# First summarize the median gdpPercap by continent in 1952:
by_continent <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(medianGdpPercap = median(gdpPercap))
# Create a bar plot showing medianGdp by continent:
ggplot(by_continent, aes(continent, medianGdpPercap)) + 
  geom_col() # x is categorical variable, y is the variable that determines the height of the bars.
# Unlike scatter plots or line plots, bar plots always start at zero.
# Visualize GDP per capita by country in Oceania in 1952:
oceania_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952, continent == "Oceania")
# Create a bar plot of gdpPercap by country:
ggplot(oceania_1952, aes(country, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_col() # Oceania has 2 countries, therefore only 2 columns.

# 4.4 Histogram ####

# A histogram is useful for examining the distribution of a numeric variable. 
# Create a histogram showing the distribution of life expectancy in the year 1952:
gapminder_1952 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1952) %>%
  mutate(pop_by_mil = pop / 1000000)
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(pop_by_mil)) + 
  geom_histogram() # histogram has only x-axis representing the variable whose distribution we're examining.
# Customize the width of the column with bindwith() to make the histogram focuses more on the general shape more than the small details:
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(pop_by_mil)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50) # each of the bar represents a width of 50 million.
# There are several countries with a much higher population than others, which causes the distribution cramming into a small part of the graph. To make the histogram more informative, put the x-axis on a log scale:
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(pop)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_log10()

# 4.5 Boxplot ####

# A boxplot is useful for comparing a distribution of values across several groups.
# Examine the distribution of GDP per capita by continent in 1952:
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot()
# Since GDP per capita varies across several orders of magnitude, we'll need to put the y-axis on a log scale.
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10()
# Add a title to the graph: 
ggplot(gapminder_1952, aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  ggtitle("Comparing GDP per capita across continents").
